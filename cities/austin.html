   <h1>Things to do in Austin</h1>
   <p>
    Years ago when people talked about Austin they would quickly mention the music. But that's just the beginning of what they're saying these days. Austin is also home to a wonderful ballet, world-class museums, one-of-a-kind shopping and beautiful outdoor spaces. With so many things to do in Austin, you can just as easily spend your morning paddling the lake as you can strolling through a celebrated history museum. And it's okay if you don't have time to fit it all in, you can just come back and visit us again.

    Austin is known as the Live Music Capital of the WorldÂ® but that's just the beginning. Home to unique attractions and world-class museums, Texas' capital city has a soundtrack all its own. Spend a day exploring sculpture gardens and historic homes, zipline through the Hill Country or give the kids a hands-on experience at a number of STEM museums. Discover Austin attractions.
