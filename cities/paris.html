    <h1>Welcome to Paris</h1>
    <p>
        Ah, Paris, the city of life, love, and light. From the Eiffel Tower to the Mona Lisa, from the bustling Champs Elysées to the winding streets of Montmartre, you'll find magic, romance, and history as you sip a café au lait, stroll manicured parks, and watch the sun set over the Seine. The home to some 2 million people, Paris could take you multiple lifetimes to explore from top to bottom—and that's not counting the Louvre. Happily, the métro system is extremely efficient and will aid you in see-and-flee sight-seeing. But to truly savor Paris's heady parfum, opt for the bus, or even better, your feet. In no time at all, you'll be strolling like a true Parisian from the arty Rive Gauche (Left Bank) to the regal Rive Droite (Right Bank).

        Masterpieces Theater : There will always be something new to see at the Louvre—after all, the Mona Lisa is just one of its 800,000 treasures.Feasting at Le Grand Véfour : Back when Napoléon dined here, this was the most beautiful restaurant in Paris. Guess what? It still is Quasimodo's Notre Dame : Get to know the stone gargoyles high atop this erstwhile playground of Victor Hugo's hunchback, then savor the splendor inside this great Gothic cathedral.Café Society : Whether you prefer a posh perch at Les Deux Magots or just the corner café, be sure to Hemingway an afternoon away over two café filtrés.A Walk along the Seine : Pretend you're Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade with a jaunt along the Rive Gauche or a romance aboard the Bateaux Mouches.
